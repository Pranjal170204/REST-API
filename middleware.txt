Middleware-->req first goes to Middleware and it processes the request and then forward the req to next middleware or req handler function at end
which sends response back to client

-->middleware can also revert back reqs to client due to some reasons

-->functions of middleware
1--Execute any code
2--make changes to req and res objects
3--End the req-res cycle
4--Call the middleware function in stack


req obj is available to next middleware also
